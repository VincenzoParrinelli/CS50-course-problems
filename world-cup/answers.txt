Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations (below 100.000) it appears that we are missing predictions about some teams i

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 100.000 number of simulations run
